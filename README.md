# Hello-World
First thing first.
I was born 153 dog years ago at almost 16404 feet from sea level, 7236 miles away. Stop me when you get bored me telling stories about  Microsoft, momos, khukuris, Nikon cameras, oil on canvases, hawaii, sea turtles, M16s, 4am wakeups to salute the flag, the first time I met Nicole.
